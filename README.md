My codes for advent of code 2023

This if my first time coding in Rust. 

Before, I had only read the rust book (https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) up until (including) chapter 4.2 (about references and borrowing).

One can use this repo to learn a bit about rust and advent of code but there should be way better resources elsewhere (e.g. https://www.reddit.com/r/adventofcode/).

This was mostly done for fun and learning.


## Compiling and Running
All codes were compiled with `rustc 1.73.0 (cc66ad468 2023-10-03)` on a `Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-6700HQ CPU @ 2.60GHz`.

It was decided not to use `cargo` unless really necessary since the codes are usually on a single file and about a couple hundred lines long.

To compile and run `part_one.rs` of a day:

- GNU/Linux:

`rustc part_one.rs && ./part_one`

- Windows:

`rustc part_one.rs && part_one.exe`
